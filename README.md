## BookSwap — University Textbook Exchange Platform

BookSwap is an experimental, concept-driven web application built using C# (ASP.NET Web Forms) and SQL Server.
The platform is designed to provide a structured, reliable system that allows university students to exchange, sell, and browse academic books within their campus community.

This project serves as a demonstration of practical full-stack development skills, including database integration, authentication systems, data management, and user-centered interface design.
